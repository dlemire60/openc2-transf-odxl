<p>OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work">GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work</a>, are governed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">TC Process</a>, <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr">IPR Policy</a>, and other policies, similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories">OASIS Open Repositories</a>, which are used for development of open source <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses">licensed</a> content.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This GitHub repository supports development of content and change tracking for the OpenC2 OpenDXL transfer specification as new working draft level revisions are created and the associated CSDs mature. OpenDXL is a
messaging bus which provides a standardized application framework for the sharing of information in real time. 

This repository is designed to support TC members' work on a formal specification that describes the use of OpenDXL as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 messages. The provisional Work Product title is "Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via OpenDXL, Version 1.0", edited by Duncan Sparrell (sFractal Consulting) and Scott MacGregor (McAfee). The specification explains the transfer of OpenC2 command and response messages using OpenDXL.

<h3>Organization</h3>
This repository is organized with three branches:

* The _Working_ branch contains work product material that is actively being developed, and subject to potentially frequent and significant change. Contributors to the work product should target their inputs to the Working branch.

* The _Releases_ branch contains incremental releases (i.e., Working Drafts) of the work product. The current contents of the Working branch are merged into the Releases branch to create a working WD. 

* The _Master_ branch contains TC-approved [Committee Specification](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dCommitteeSpec) (CS) and [OASIS Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dOASISstandard) versions of the work product. Until the first CS is approved, the Master branch will not contain a complete version of the work product.
